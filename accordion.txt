                    Besides the usual reasons adults learn a new language
                    (career opportunities or romance) there are plenty of other
                    benefits for kids to learn a new language. Improved memory:
                    Learning a foreign language involves memorizing vocabulary
                    and grammar, which enhances overall memory function.
                    According to a study published in the journal
                    "Neuropsychology," bilingualism has been linked to better
                    memory performance (Bialystok et al., 2004). Problem-solving
                    skills: Language learning stimulates critical thinking and
                    problem-solving abilities. Research published in the journal
                    "Psychological Science" suggests that bilingual individuals
                    excel in tasks that require cognitive control and
                    problem-solving (Green & Abutalebi, 2013). Increased
                    creativity: Language learners often find creative ways to
                    express themselves. Studies, such as one published in
                    "Frontiers in Psychology," have shown that bilingualism is
                    associated with greater cognitive flexibility and divergent
                    thinking, key components of creativity (Kharkhurin, 2012).

                    Kids get the opportunity to explore, do you (parents) still
                    remember the foreign language you learnt years ago at school
                    or at university. Chances are you won't remember much of it.
                    Starting early gives children to explore their interests
                    Children are just better at learning stuff Longer time to
                    learn a language: The usual pathway to study in a university
                    overseas will be to study a language intensively for 1-2
                    years after SPM. Starting early gives gives them the
                    opportunity to learn at a slower pace and enjoy the process
                    more than just cramming things in your head to pass that
                    next exam Save costs: Pre university foreign language
                    courses can be quite heavy for students to bear in a short
                    space of time. We help reduce these costs greatly and help
                    parents space out the costs, so it will not feel as much a
                    burden
